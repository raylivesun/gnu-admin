     <h4>IV.
        BASES FOR THE so(5) LIE ALGEBRA</h4>
        <p>The VCS representations of so(5) in an SO(3)-coupled basis make use of two bases for the so(5) Lie algebra: a
            Cartan basis of root vectors and a basis of components of SO(3) tensors.</p>
            <h4>A.
                A Cartan basis</h4>
                <p>Starting from two copies of the (10) irrep, one spanned by the creation operators {ην† } and one spanned by the
                    annihilation operators {ην }, one can construct a realisation of the the so(5) Lie algebra, which carries a (01) irrep,
                    by taking an antisymmetric tensor product of the two. This gives the so(5) root vectors of figure 1 as a subset of u(5)
                    operators</p>

            <p>A realisation of the so(5) algebra as a subalgebra of u(4) is similarly obtained from the symmetric tensor product
