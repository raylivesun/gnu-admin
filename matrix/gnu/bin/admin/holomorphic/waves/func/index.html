     <h4>B.
        A model space of VCS wave functions</h4>
        <hr/>
        <p>A model space for a compact Lie group G is a representation of G which is a direct sum of irreps comprising
            precisely one copy from each equivalence class of irreps [30]. As emphasised by Biedenharn and Flath [31], a model
            space provides a valuable framework for a realisation of the tensor algebra of the group. We now show that a Hilbert
            space of VCS wave functions for the states of H provides a model space with very useful properties.
            It follows from Eq. (7) that, provided the conditions of Theorem 1 are satisfied, any state |ψi in H has VCS wave
            function Ψ given by</p>

            <p>Now observe that, if the wave functions {ξm } of the highest grade states are expressed in Bargmann form as the
                holomorphic functions</p>

                <p>then, using Eq. (16), the u(2)-intertwining operator
                    X
                    P
                    (vf )
                    vf m ξm h(vf )m| can be expressed</p>

        <p>Thus, any state |ψi in H has VCS wave function defined by</p>

        <p>Let F (vf ) denote the Hilbert space of VCS wave functions for an so(5) irrep of highest weight (vf ), relative to the</p>

        <p>of all such Hilbert spaces. Hence, by construction, it is a model space for so(5). The following theorem, which
            generalises a theorem of Rowe and Hecht [22], shows that F is also a ring and that it can be generated from the VCS
            wave functions of the fundamental irreps (1,0) and (0, 12 ).

<p>then, if Φ1 is in F (v1 f1 ) and Φ2 is in F (v2 f2 ) , the product Φ is in F (v1 +v2 ,f1 +f2 ) . Moreover, if F (v1 f1 ) ⊙ F (v2 f2 ) denotes</p>

<p>Proof: Let Ẑ1 1 1 be a homogeneous polynomial of degree v1 in the {ην† } raising operators and degree 2f1 in the

    <p>The successive terms in the sequence of multiple commutators inside the brackets are homogenous polynomials of
        decreasing degree in the raising operators. This sequence terminates with a polynomial of degree zero (a number)

        expectation value. It follows that</p>

        <p>If Z2 2 2 is similarly defined for the wave function Φ2 2 2 , then the wave function Φ = Φ1 1 1 ⊙ Φ2 2 2 has values

<p>The state Ẑ1 1 1 Ẑ2 2 2 |0i does not necessarily belong to an irreducible so(5) subspace. However, it is of degree
    †
    (v1 + v2 ) and 2(f1 + f2 ) in the {ην† } and {ζm
    } operators, respectively, and, therefore, only the component of the state
    (v1 f1 ) (v2 f2 )
    Ẑ2
    |0i that does lie within the irreducible SO(5) subspace of highest weight (v1 + v2 , f1 + f2 ) will have
    Ẑ1
    non-zero overlap with h0|eX̂ R̂(Ω). Thus, Φ is a VCS wave function for a state belonging to an SO(5) irrep of highest
    weight (v1 + v2 , f1 + f2 ) as claimed by the theorem. The second part of the theorem follows from the observation
    (vf )
    that, if {Ẑα } is a basis for the linear space P (vf ) of homogeneous polynomials of degree v in {ην† } and degree 2f in
    (v f ) (v f )
    †
    QED
    {ζm
    }, then the space P (v1 +v2 ,f1 +f2 ) is spanned by the products {Ẑα11 1 Ẑα22 2 }.</p>
<p>The theorem shows that F can be constructed from the two fundamental irreps, and that this process will generate
    all the irreps of so(5). The importance of a model space is that, since it is multiplicity free, calculations performed in
    F are not complicated by any need to keep track of equivalent copies of the same so(5) irreps.</p>
