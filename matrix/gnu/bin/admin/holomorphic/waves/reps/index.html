     <h4>C.
        VCS wave functions in an SO(3)-coupled basis</h4>
        <hr/>
        <p>The group SO(3) can be embedded as a subgroup in SO(5) in many ways. We consider the SO(3) subgroup defined
            up to conjugation by regarding SO(5) as a group of orthogonal transformations of the five-dimensional carrier space4
            for an L = 2 irrep of SO(3). This embedding is motivated by the rotational properties of the five quadrupole degrees
            of freedom in the nuclear collective model. The construction of an SO(3)-coupled basis for a VCS irrep of so(5) then
            parallels a similar construction of an SO(3)-coupled basis for a VCS irrep of su(3) [26]. The so(5) construction makes
            use of the following theorem, which constrains the choice of the SO(3) subgroup.</p>
        <p>Theorem 1: Provided no so(3) angular momentum operator lies within the u(2) intrinsic subalgebra, the set of
            states {R̂(Ω)|(vf )mi; m = −f, . . . , f ; Ω ∈ SO(3)} obtained by all SO(3) rotations of an orthonormal basis for the
            highest grade subspace spans the Hilbert space for the so(5) irrep (vf )</p>
            <p>Proof: The set of states generated by repeated application of the lowering operators {Ŝ− , X̂− , T̂− } to the highest
                grade states spans the Hilbert space of the irrep. Now, if {L̂i ; i = 1, 2, 3} is a hermitian basis for the so(3) ⊂ so(5)
                +
                −
                0
                0
                subalgebra, then each L̂i can be expanded L̂i = L̂−
                i + L̂i + L̂i , where L̂i is a grade lowering operator, L̂i is of grade
                +
                +
                zero, and L̂i is a grade raising operator. By hermiticity, if L̂i has a non-zero component L̂i , it must also have a
                −
                non-zero L̂−
                i component. Thus, if no L̂i lies in the zero grade u(2) subalgebra, then each L̂i must have a nonzero L̂i
                −
                component. By linear independence, it must be that the span of {L̂i } equals the span of {Ŝ− , X̂− , T̂− }.</p>
        <p>This theorem means that an arbitrary state |ψi in an irrep (vf ) is defined by the set of overlaps
            {h(vf )m|R̂(Ω)|ψi; m = −f, . . . , +f ; Ω ∈ SO(3)}, provided that the SO(3) subgroup is chosen as required by the
            theorem, which we assume from now on. It also means that, if {|(vf )τ LM i} is an SO(3)-coupled basis for an so(5)
            (vf )
            irrep and {|(vf )mi}, with wave functions {ξm }, is an orthonormal u(2) basis of highest grade states for this irrep,
            then the basis states {|(vf )τ LM i} have VCS wave functions given as vector-valued functions over SO(3) by</p>

            <p>These wave functions are very much like rotor-model wave functions [11]. Indeed, with basis states chosen to have
                good SO(3) transformation properties, they can be expanded</p>

                <p>where DL (Ω) is a Wigner rotation matrix. It follows that a basis state |(vf )τ LM i is characterised by the set of
                    expansion coefficients</p>

        <p>The following gives a systematic procedure for determining these coefficients and for deriving the transformations
            of these coefficients by elements of the so(5) Lie algebra as defined by the VCS representation</p>
