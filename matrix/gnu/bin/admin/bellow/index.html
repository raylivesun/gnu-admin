    <h4>III.REPRESENTATION SPACES FOR so(5)</h4>
    <h5>A.A subspace of harmonic oscillator states</h5>
    <p>Irreps of so(5) can be built up from its two fundamental irreps with highest weights (10) and (0 12 ). The former is
        the fundamental five dimensional irrep, the latter is the fundamental four dimensional irrep. Both weight diagrams
        are shown in figure 3. These fundamental irreps are carried by the spaces generated by the raising operators {ην† ; ν =
        †
        0, ±1, ±2} of a five-dimensional harmonic oscillator with symmetry group U(5) and by the raising operators {ζm
        ;m =
        3
        1
        ± 2 , ± 2 } of a four-dimensional harmonic oscillator with symmetry group U(4), respectively. The operators {ην† } and
        †
        {ζm
        }, together with the corresponding lowering operators, satisfy the usual boson commutation relations</p>

        This realisation exhibits SO(5) as a subgroup of U(5). The four-dimensional fundamental irrep is a spinor irrep of

        the two-fold cover of SO(5), as a subgroup of U(4). Because every irrep of a group is contained in a tensor product of
        copies of its fundamental irreps, it follows that every irrep of so(5) can be realised on a subspace of the tensor product
        H = H(5) ⊗ H(4) , where H(n) is the Hilbert space of an n-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Highest grade states for an
