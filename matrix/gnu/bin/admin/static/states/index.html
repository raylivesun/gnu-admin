    <p>FIG. 1: Root diagram for the so(5) Lie algebra.</p>
    <p>separate the roots of a semisimple Lie algebra into positive and negative roots and to regard the corresponding root
        vectors as raising and lowering operators, respectively. Every irrep is then characterised by a highest weight state.
        Let α1 be the root corresponding to the vector T+ and α2 be that corresponding to F+ . Then in the standard
        labelling scheme, the highest weight Λ for an irrep is given by two integers λ1 and λ2 such that Λ = (λ1 + 12 λ2 )α1 +
        (λ1 + λ2 )α2 . In keeping with the nuclear structure notation, we use the label v = λ1 (the “seniority”), and find it
        convenient to introduce the half-integer f = 21 λ2 since it also labels a u(2) irrep, as is shown below. Thus, we label
        an so(5) irrep (vf ); the highest weight is then given by Λ = (v + f )(α1 + α2 ) + f α2 .
        For present purposes, we separate the root vectors into grade raising, grade conserving, and grade lowering operators
        as shown in figure 2. The horizontal grade-conserving root vectors {F± , F0 , X0 } then define what we shall refer to
        as any.</p>
        <p>irrep has a set of highest grade states {|(vf )mi} that are annihilated by the grade-raising operators T̂+ , X̂+ , and Ŝ+ ,</p>

            so(5) irrep are shown in the second diagram.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p>functions {ξm ; m = −f, . . . , f } for these highest grade states are regarded as intrinsic wave functions in the VCS
                construction — it is in the Hilbert space of these intrinsic functions that the VCS wave functions take their vector
                values.</p>
