     <h4>Vector Coherent state representations</h4>
     <hr/>
     <p>Vector coherent state (VCS) theory is a generalisation of standard (scalar) coherent state theory [23]. It was
        introduced [1] for the purpose of providing an explicit systematic construction of the irreducible unitary representations
        of the compact and non-compact symplectic Lie algebras. Simplicity and efficiency were achieved in the construction
        by making use of the already well-known representation theory of the unitary subalgebras. Important aspects of
        the theory were also introduced independently by Deenen and Quesne in their partial coherent state representations
        [24]. Subsequently, VCS has been used to construct representations of a large number of Lie algebras, groups,
        and superalgebras (cf. Ref. [6] for a review). Early applications of VCS theory gave realisations of the so-called
        holomorphic representations (reviewed by Hecht [25]). A more general class of VCS representations was later used in
        the construction of su(3) irreps in an so(3) basis [26]. It has also been shown that VCS theory is compatible with the
        theory of induced representations [6] and the theory of geometric quantisation [27]. A more general perspective on
        the theory was given in Ref. [28].</p>
        <p>The construction of the finite-dimensional irreps of so(5) in an so(3) basis has much in common with the construction
            of irreps of su(3) in an so(3) basis. The su(3) Lie algebra is spanned by the components of so(3) tensors of angular
            momentum L = 1 and L = 2, while the so(5) Lie algebra is spanned by so(3) tensors of angular momentum L = 1
            and L = 3. However, whereas for su(3) it was possible to use scalar coherent state wave functions, a special case of
            VCS functions, it proves to be essential to use vector-valued wave functions for so(5).
            The VCS theory of su(3) relies on the fact that the carrier space for an su(3) irrep is spanned by the set of states
            generated by SO(3) rotations of a highest weight state. The carrier space for a generic irrep of so(5) is generated by
            SO(3) rotations of a set of highest grade states.</p>
