    <h3>Abstract</h3>    
    <p>For applications of group theory in quantum mechanics, one generally needs explicit matrix repre-
        sentations of the spectrum generating algebras that arise in bases that reduce the symmetry group of
        some Hamiltonian of interest. Here we use vector coherent state techniques to develop an algorithm
        for constructing the matrices for arbitrary finite-dimensional irreps of the SO(5) Lie algebra in an
        SO(3) basis. The SO(3) subgroup of SO(5) is defined by regarding SO(5) as linear transformations
        of the five-dimensional space of an SO(3) irrep of angular momentum two. A need for such irreps
        arises in the nuclear collective model of quadrupole vibrations and rotations. The algorithm has
        been implemented in MAPLE, and some tables of results are presented.</p>

        INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>A vector coherent state (VCS) representation is a representation of a group (or Lie algebra) on a space of vector-
            valued functions. It is a representation induced from a multi-dimensional representation of a subgroup. Such rep-
            resentations have been used widely in the construction of explicit representations of Lie algebras and Lie groups
            [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], in the construction of shift tensors [7], and for the computation of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for
            reducing tensor product representations [8, 9].</p>
            <p>The VCS construction for a representation of a group G involves two subgroups which play quite different roles.
                A so-called “intrinsic” subgroup (sometimes called the “core” subgroup) acts in a known way on a subspace of the
                representation of interest. A second “orbiter” subgroup acts upon this subspace to generate the larger representation
                of the group G. A prototypical example of the construction is that for the dynamical group of the rigid rotor given
                by the semi-direct product G = R5 ⋉SO(3) of an intrinsic R5 subgroup, which describes the quadrupole moments
                (hence the shape) of an object, and an orbiter group SO(3), corresponding to physical rotations of the object, which
                describes its possible orientations. The quantum mechanics of such a rotor are then described by the unitary irreducible
                representations (irreps) of G.</p>
                <p>The key requirement is that the Lie algebras of the intrinsic and orbiter groups, together with those elements
                    of the complexified Lie algebra gC of G which leave the intrinsic space invariant, span the complex extension of
                    the Lie algebra. Finding such groups is often easier in the complex extension of G. In many cases there are then
                    mathematically naturally choices of intrinsic and orbiter subgroups for which the VCS construction of an induced
                    representation is straightforward. Unfortunately a mathematically natural choice often produces a representation in a
                    basis which is not adapted to the symmetries of a physical problem. A goal of this paper is to show how to construct
                    representations of so(5) in a basis which reduces a physically relevant so(3) ⊂ so(5) subalgebra.</p>
        <p>resentations of so(5) in a basis which reduces a physically relevant so(3) ⊂ so(5) subalgebra.
            The group SO(5) and its Lie algebra so(5) arise in many physical contexts. For example, they are needed for
            the classification of states in the Bohr-Mottelson model [11] and Interacting Boson model [12] of nuclear collective
            states. They arise in a charge-independent pairing theory and in the use of isospin for the classification of nuclear
            shell model basis states [13, 14].</p>
            <p>They have also been used for the study of algebraic many-body equations of motion
                methods [15] and high-temperature superconductivity [16]. Depending on the context, so(5) irreps may be required
                in an su(2) (e.g., isospin) or an so(3) (angular momentum) basis. The isospin su(2) algebra is embedded in so(5) as
                a subalgebra su(2) ⊂ su(2) × su(2) ∼
                = so(4) ⊂ so(5). Thus, the requirement.</p>
                <p>Thus, the required so(5) ⊃ su(2) irreps are given in a basis that
                    reduces the Gel’fand chain SO(5) ⊃ SO(4) ⊃ SO(3) ⊃ SO(2) [17]. Such irreps were constructed years ago [14, 18]
                    and reconstructed more simply by VCS methods in Refs. [3, 19]. Note, however, that the so(3) ⊂ so(4) subalgebra
                    of the SO(3) group in the Gel’fand chain is not the same as the above-mentioned angular momentum algebra which
                    generates a “geometrical” SO(3) ⊂ SO(5) subgroup of rotations of an associated three-dimensional space; as a result
                    the construction of so(5) irreps in an angular-momentum basis is more challenging</p>
                    <p>The so-called one-rowed representations that occur in the decomposition of the Hilbert space of the 5-dimensional
                        harmonic oscillator can be inferred in an so(3) basis from the results of Chaćon, Moshinsky and others [20] or from the
                        SO(5) hyperspherical harmonics and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients given in Ref. [21]. An explicit VCS (vector coherent
                        state) construction of irreps with highest weights of the type (v, 0) and (0, f ) (this notation is explained below) was

        <p>In this paper we give a systematic construction of the generic (v, f ) irreps in an so(3) basis. In addition to its
            obvious relevance to the representation theory of so(5), the construction is a prototype for a relatively sophisticated
            application of VCS theory.</p>
